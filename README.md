## Introduction
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for California housing prices using machine learning techniques. This notebook walks through data preprocessing, normalization, model building, and evaluation steps for effective price prediction.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following software is installed:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd california-housing-price-prediction
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook california_housing.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Open `california_housing.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute each cell in sequence to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Normalize the data.
   - Train the model and assess its performance.

## Notebook Structure
1. **Data Loading**: Imports the California Housing dataset from Scikit-Learn.
2. **Data Splitting**: Divides the data into training, validation, and test sets.
3. **Data Normalization**: Scales the data using `StandardScaler` to improve training performance.
4. **Model Training**: Builds a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras, trains it on the dataset, and validates it.
5. **Evaluation**: Analyzes model accuracy and performance on the test set.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance metrics and error rates are evaluated to provide insights into its accuracy in predicting housing prices.
